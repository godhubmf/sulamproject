# Feature-Based Skeleton Implementation

## Overview
The SulamProject has been restructured with a complete feature-based architecture. This document provides an overview of the implementation and next steps.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Directory Structure ✓
Complete feature-based skeleton created:
```

│   ├── components/
│   │   └── layouts/          # Base layout templates

```

### 2. Shared Services ✓

#### Database (PDO-based)
- **Location**: `features/shared/lib/database/Database.php`
- **Features**: Singleton PDO wrapper with prepared statements
- **Bootstrap**: `features/shared/lib/database/db-bootstrap.php`

#### Authentication & Session
- **AuthService**: `features/shared/lib/auth/AuthService.php`
- **Session helpers**: `features/shared/lib/auth/session.php`
- **Functions**: `isAuthenticated()`, `requireAuth()`, `isAdmin()`, `requireAdmin()`

#### Security
- **CSRF Protection**: `features/shared/lib/utilities/csrf.php`
- **Validation**: `features/shared/lib/utilities/validation.php`
- **Helper Functions**: `features/shared/lib/utilities/functions.php`

#### Base Controller
- **Location**: `features/shared/controllers/BaseController.php`
- **Features**: Common authentication checks, JSON responses, view rendering

#### Audit Logging
- **Location**: `features/shared/lib/audit/audit-log.php`
- **Features**: Log to file (will migrate to database once audit_logs table exists)

### 3. Central Front Controller ✓
- **Router**: `features/shared/lib/utilities/Router.php`
- **Routes**: `routes.php` (defines all application routes)
- **Entry Point**: `index.php` (dispatches requests)
- **URL Rewriting**: `.htaccess` configured for clean URLs

### 4. Feature Implementation Status

#### Users/Authentication ✓
- Login controller and view
- Register controller and view
- Logout functionality
- CSRF protection enabled
- Password hashing and verification

#### Dashboard ✓
- Admin dashboard view
- User dashboard view
- Role-based separation
- Dashboard controller

#### Other Features (Placeholder Views)
- Residents
- Donations
- Events
- Assistance (structure only)
- Death & Funeral (structure only)
- Reports (structure only)

### 5. CSS Assets ✓
- **Shared Variables**: `features/shared/assets/css/variables.css`
- **Base Styles**: `features/shared/assets/css/base.css`
- **Feature-specific**: Each feature has its own assets directory
- **Naming Convention**: Feature-prefixed classes (e.g., `.dashboard-card`)

### 6. Database Migration Plan ✓
- **Location**: `database/migrations/migration-plan.md`
- **Tables Defined**: 
  - Authentication (roles, user_roles, auth_attempts)
  - Residents (households, residents, relationships)
  - Assistance (applications, assessments, approvals, disbursements)
  - Donations (donors, donations, receipts)
  - Death & Funeral (notifications, logistics)
  - Events
  - Audit logs

### 7. Backward Compatibility ✓
All root PHP files maintained as shims:
- `login.php` → Routes to AuthController
- `register.php` → Routes to AuthController
- `dashboard.php` → Redirects to /dashboard
- `logout.php` → Routes to AuthController
- `residents.php`, `donations.php`, `events.php` → Redirect to new routes

## Current State

### Working Features
1. **Authentication**: Login, register, logout with CSRF protection
2. **Session Management**: Secure session handling with regeneration
3. **Routing**: Central front controller with clean URLs
4. **Dashboard**: Role-based dashboards (admin vs user)
5. **Database**: PDO-based connection with auto-provisioning
6. **Security**: Input validation, CSRF tokens, password hashing

## How to Use

### Development Setup
1. Ensure Laragon is running (Apache + MySQL)
2. Visit `http://localhost/sulamproject/` or `http://localhost/sulamproject/register.php` to bootstrap database
3. Register first user (will be admin by default once role system is implemented)
4. Login and access dashboard

### URL Structure
- `/` → Landing page (redirects to /login or /dashboard based on auth)
- `/login` → Login page
- `/register` → Registration page
- `/dashboard` → Dashboard (role-based)
- `/residents` → Residents management
- `/donations` → Donations tracking
- `/events` → Events management
- `/logout` → Logout

### Adding a New Feature
1. Create feature directory: `features/your-feature/{shared,admin,user}`
2. Create controller in `admin/controllers/` or `user/controllers/`
3. Create views in respective `views/` directories
4. Add routes in `routes.php`
5. Create feature-specific CSS in `assets/css/`
6. Add models/services in `shared/lib/`

### Code Patterns

#### Creating a Controller
```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/../../../shared/controllers/BaseController.php';

class YourController extends BaseController {
    public function index() {
        $this->requireAuth(); // or $this->requireAdmin()
        
        // Your logic here
        
        ob_start();
        include __DIR__ . '/../views/index.php';
        $dashboardContent = ob_get_clean();
        
        ob_start();
        include __DIR__ . '/../../../shared/components/layouts/dashboard-layout.php';
        $content = ob_get_clean();
        
        $pageTitle = 'Your Page';
        include __DIR__ . '/../../../shared/components/layouts/base.php';
    }
}
```

#### Adding a Route
```php
// In routes.php
$router->get('/your-route', function() {
    initSecureSession();
    requireAuth();
    
    $controller = new YourController();
    $controller->index();
});
```

#### Database Queries
```php
$db = Database::getInstance();

// Fetch all
$users = $db->fetchAll("SELECT * FROM users WHERE role = ?", ['admin']);

// Fetch one
$user = $db->fetchOne("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", [1]);

// Execute (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
$db->execute("UPDATE users SET email = ? WHERE id = ?", [$email, $id]);
$lastId = $db->lastInsertId();
```

## Notes

- **PDO Migration**: All new code uses PDO. Old `db.php` (mysqli) still exists but should not be used for new features.
- **Security**: All forms must include CSRF tokens. All database queries must use prepared statements.
- **Audit Logging**: Currently logs to file. Will migrate to database once audit_logs table is created.
- **Asset Loading**: CSS paths in layouts point to `/features/shared/assets/css/`. Update as needed for production.
- **Error Handling**: Errors currently log to `storage/logs/`. Implement centralized error handling for production.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login with correct credentials
- [ ] Login with incorrect credentials
- [ ] Access dashboard after login
- [ ] Access admin-only pages with admin role
- [ ] Access user pages with regular user role
- [ ] Logout successfully
- [ ] CSRF protection on all forms
- [ ] Session regeneration on privilege changes

- [ ] URL rewriting works (clean URLs)
- [ ] Backward compatibility with old PHP files

## Deployment Notes

### Before Production
1. Update `.htaccess` to set secure session cookies (HTTPS)
2. Implement database migrations (run migration scripts)
3. Set up environment variables for database credentials
4. Configure error logging to separate file/service
5. Enable rate limiting for authentication
6. Review and update security headers in `.htaccess`
7. Test on production-like environment

### Environment Variables
Create `.env` file (not in version control):
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=masjid
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=your_password
APP_DEBUG=false
```
